# Bouncing-off-the-edges-DVD-logo

Simulate the nostalgic DVD logo screensaver using this program. If you're familiar with the era of DVD players, you'll remember the iconic bouncing DVD logo that would traverse the screen diagonally, elegantly bouncing off the edges. This Python program brings that classic screensaver to life, complete with changing directions upon collision with the screen edges. The added touch is the collision counter that keeps track of how many times the logo hits the edges.

**Please note:** To experience this program's visual effects, run it from the command line or terminal due to its reliance on the `bext` module.
